# Edge Case Handling in Julia Conditional Logic

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Julia related to edge case handling within conditional statements (`if`, `elseif`, `else`). The original code fails to properly classify inputs at the boundary between the defined ranges. The solution provides an improved version that correctly manages these edge cases.

## Bug Description:

The initial Julia function (`myfunction`) contains a flaw in its handling of boundary values (5 and 10).  The `elseif` condition only considers values strictly less than 5.  This means inputs of 5 and 10 are incorrectly categorized as "medium".

## Solution:

The solution corrects this by explicitly checking for equality in the conditional statements.
